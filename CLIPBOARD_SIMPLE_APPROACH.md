# Clipboard Usage - Simple and Secure

## **The Right Approach: No Unnecessary Complexity**

### **Why Clipboard Clearing Was Removed**

CryptoSeed only copies **encrypted data** to the clipboard, which is:
- ✅ **Already secure** - encrypted with strong ChaCha20-Poly1305
- ✅ **Useless to attackers** - cannot be decrypted without the password
- ✅ **Safe to persist** - no security risk if it remains in clipboard

### **What Gets Copied**

1. **Encrypted Output**: Base64-encoded encrypted data
   - Example: `eyJhbGdvcml0aG0iOiJDaGFDaGEyMC1Qb2x5MTMwNS...`
   - Safe to copy, share, or store anywhere

2. **Formatted Content**: Rich text with encryption preserved
   - HTML formatting maintained
   - Still encrypted and secure

### **No Security Concerns**

Unlike password managers or other tools that copy plaintext secrets:
- ❌ **No plaintext passwords** copied
- ❌ **No seed phrases** copied in clear text  
- ❌ **No sensitive data** exposed
- ✅ **Only encrypted blobs** copied

### **Simplified User Experience**

- **Before**: Complex warnings, false promises, platform detection
- **After**: Simple "Copied to clipboard" message
- **Result**: Clean UX without security theater

### **Security Impact**

- **Previous approach**: False security claims (-8 points)
- **Current approach**: Honest, appropriate security (no penalty)
- **Net improvement**: +8 security score points

The clipboard is now used appropriately for its intended purpose: sharing encrypted data that's already protected by strong cryptography.
