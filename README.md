## What Does CryptoSeed Do?
- **Encrypts and Decrypts Seed Phrases:**
  - Securely encrypt and store your wallet recovery phrases or any sensitive text using ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption.
- **Simple Text Encryption:**
  - Clean, straightforward text encryption with textarea input for maximum compatibility and security.
  - Focus on security over formatting - plain text approach eliminates potential attack vectors.
- **Zero-Knowledge:**
  - All encryption and decryption happen locally in your browser. No data ever leaves your device.
- **Military-Grade Security:**
  - Uses ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption with Argon2id key derivation (OWASP recommended) and secure memory handling.
- **File Export/Import:**
  - Download encrypted content as `.cryptoseed` files with metadata and compression.
  - Load `.cryptoseed` files for seamless decryption workflow.
- **Optimized Output:**
  - Gzip compression before encryption reduces file sizes significantly.
- **Smart Offline Detection:**
  - Real-time offline indicator with usage recommendations for maximum security.
- **Clipboard Auto-Wipe & Session Timeout:**
  - Prevents sensitive data from lingering in memory or clipboard.
- **Password Strength Meter:**
  - Helps you choose strong, secure passwords.
