## Introduction

CryptoSeed is a secure, browser-based AES-256 encryptor. This tool helps you protect your sensitive data with military-grade encryption, ensuring that your data remains private and secure without the need to send anything online. CryptoSeed is designed to be fast, private, and easy to use.

## Features

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key length for strong encryption.
- **Enhanced Key Derivation**: Implements PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations of SHA-256 for secure password-based key generation.
- **Local Encryption**: Performs all encryption and decryption operations locally in your browser, ensuring that no data is ever sent online.
- **Versioned Format**: Uses a versioned encryption format for backward compatibility with future security improvements.
- **Secure Memory Handling**: Implements memory wiping to protect sensitive data after use.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy encryption and decryption of files and text.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with a modern web browser.
- **Progressive Web App**: Can be installed as a standalone application and works offline.
