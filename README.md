## üîê Metadata Handling & Security Architecture

### Core Encryption Metadata (Cryptographically Protected)
CryptoSeed embeds essential metadata directly into the encrypted binary structure:

```
Binary Structure: [version][salt][nonce][aad][ciphertext]
- version: 1 byte (always 3 for V3)
- salt: 32 bytes (256-bit random salt for Argon2id)  
- nonce: 12 bytes (96-bit random nonce for ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- aad: 8 bytes (Additional Authenticated Data)
- ciphertext: variable length (actual encrypted content)
```

### Additional Authenticated Data (AAD)
The AAD contains cryptographically protected metadata that prevents tampering:
- **Timestamp:** 32-bit timestamp (seconds) - Cannot be modified without breaking decryption
- **Version:** 32-bit encryption version - Prevents downgrade attacks
- **Authentication:** Any modification to AAD breaks the entire decryption process

### File Encryption Metadata (.cryptoseed format)
For file encryption, CryptoSeed creates structured JSON files:

```json
{
  "version": "3.0",
  "algorithm": "ChaCha20-Poly1305",
  "kdf": "Argon2id", 
  "encrypted": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-18T10:30:45.123Z",
  "originalFileName": "document.pdf",
  "content": "base64_encrypted_data_here",
  "app": "CryptoSeed"
}
```

### What's NOT Stored (Zero-Knowledge Design)
- ‚ùå User information (names, IDs, etc.)
- ‚ùå System information (OS, browser, etc.) 
- ‚ùå File paths (only filename)
- ‚ùå Content hints (file types are not exposed)
- ‚ùå Password hints or derivatives
- ‚ùå Usage analytics or tracking data

### Security Guarantees
- **Tamper-evident:** Any metadata modification breaks decryption
- **Minimal exposure:** Only essential information is stored
- **Client-side only:** All metadata processing happens locally
- **No leakage:** Zero personal or system information collected
