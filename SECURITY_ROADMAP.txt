# üî• CRYPTOSEED SECURITY OVERHAUL ROADMAP üî•
# From "Crypto Toy" to "Actually Secure Tool"
# 
# Generated: June 27, 2025
# Goal: Build something that can actually protect people's crypto seeds

## üéØ MISSION STATEMENT
Transform CryptoSeed from an educational crypto tool into a production-ready,
security-hardened application capable of protecting high-value cryptocurrency
seed phrases against sophisticated attackers.

Current Status: üõ°Ô∏è (protects against casual snooping)
Target Status:  üõ°Ô∏èüõ°Ô∏èüõ°Ô∏èüõ°Ô∏è (protects against nation-state level threats)

## üó∫Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT PHASES (10-week timeline)

### PHASE 1: CRYPTO FOUNDATION OVERHAUL (Weeks 1-2)
Status: [ ] Not Started
Priority: CRITICAL

#### 1.1 Replace PBKDF2 with Argon2id
- Current: PBKDF2(password, salt, 600000, 'SHA-256') - VULNERABLE to ASIC/GPU attacks
- Target: argon2id(password, salt, {m: 65536, t: 3, p: 4}) - Competition winner
- Why: Argon2id resists specialized hardware attacks
- Files to modify: src/lib/encryption.ts, package.json
- Dependencies: @noble/hashes, argon2-browser

#### 1.2 Implement ChaCha20-Poly1305 Encryption
- Current: AES-256-GCM (good but timing attack vulnerable)
- Target: ChaCha20-Poly1305 OR XChaCha20-Poly1305
- Why: Constant-time operations, larger nonces, more resilient
- Implementation: Use @noble/ciphers library
- Benefit: No nonce reuse fears with XChaCha20

#### 1.3 Add Data Integrity & Authentication
- Current: Basic encryption only
- Target: Full authenticated encryption with metadata protection
- Structure:
  ```
  SecureContainer {
    version: number,
    algorithm: string,
    kdf_params: KDFParams,
    nonce: Uint8Array,
    ciphertext: Uint8Array,
    mac: Uint8Array,
    metadata_mac: Uint8Array
  }
  ```
- Prevents: Tampering, rollback attacks, format confusion

### PHASE 2: MEMORY & RUNTIME SECURITY (Weeks 3-4)
Status: [ ] Not Started
Priority: HIGH

#### 2.1 WebAssembly Crypto Module
- Language: Rust compiled to WASM
- Why: Secure memory handling, constant-time operations
- Features:
  - Proper memory wiping (actually works unlike JS)
  - Constant-time string comparison
  - Secure random number generation
  - Protected key storage during operations
- Files: Create src/crypto-wasm/ directory

#### 2.2 Memory Protection Strategy
- Implement SecureString class with proper destruction
- Minimize lifetime of sensitive data in memory
- Use typed arrays that can be properly zeroed
- Add memory pressure monitoring
- Implementation:
  ```
  class SecureString {
    private data: Uint8Array;
    destroy() {
      crypto.getRandomValues(this.data); // Overwrite with random
      this.data.fill(0);                 // Then zero
    }
  }
  ```

#### 2.3 Clipboard Security Overhaul
- Current: 30-second auto-wipe (INSECURE - eternity in security time)
- Target: 1-second auto-wipe with detection
- Features:
  - Detect other apps accessing clipboard
  - Warn user about clipboard risks
  - Option to disable clipboard entirely
  - Secure paste that doesn't use system clipboard

### PHASE 3: FILE FORMAT & PARSING SECURITY (Week 5)
Status: [ ] Not Started
Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH

#### 3.1 Secure Binary File Format
- Current: JSON-based .cryptoseed files (parsing vulnerabilities)
- Target: Binary format with magic bytes and versioning
- Magic bytes: [0x43, 0x53, 0x45, 0x44] ("CSED")
- Benefits: No injection attacks, smaller files, faster parsing
- Versioning: Forward/backward compatibility

#### 3.2 Parser Hardening
- Validate ALL inputs before processing
- Fail closed on any anomaly
- No dynamic parsing (fixed structure only)
- Bounds checking on all buffer operations
- Prevent buffer overflow attacks

### PHASE 4: ARCHITECTURE REDESIGN (Weeks 6-7)
Status: [ ] Not Started
Priority: HIGH

#### 4.1 True Offline-First Design
- Current: "Offline recommended" (but loads external resources)
- Target: 100% offline capable after initial load
- Implementation:
  - Service Worker for complete offline functionality
  - Local font embedding (no Google Fonts)
  - Cached crypto libraries
  - No external dependencies post-load

#### 4.2 Explicit Threat Model Definition
- Define protection levels:
  ```
  CASUAL_SNOOPING:    Spouse/coworker looking over shoulder
  MOTIVATED_ATTACKER: Someone targeting YOU specifically  
  MASS_SURVEILLANCE:  Government/corporate data collection
  NATION_STATE:       Advanced persistent threats
  ```
- Build explicit defenses for each level
- Document what we protect against vs. what we don't

#### 4.3 Zero-Knowledge Architecture
- No server components (already achieved)
- No telemetry/analytics (already achieved)
- No error reporting to external services
- Completely self-contained application
- Add offline verification tools

### PHASE 5: ADVANCED SECURITY FEATURES (Weeks 8-9)
Status: [ ] Not Started
Priority: MEDIUM

#### 5.1 Forward Secrecy Implementation
- Current: Password compromise = all data compromised forever
- Target: Each encryption uses derived keys
- Benefit: Past data stays safe even if master password is compromised
- Implementation:
  ```
  interface ForwardSecureKey {
    masterKey: Uint8Array;
    counter: number;
    deriveNextKey(): Uint8Array;
  }
  ```

#### 5.2 Steganography Option
- Hide encrypted data inside innocent-looking files
- Options:
  - PNG image steganography
  - Text steganography in lorem ipsum
  - Audio file steganography
- Benefit: Encrypted data becomes undetectable

#### 5.3 Decoy/Panic Mode
- Dual password system
- One password shows decoy data (fake seed phrases)
- Another password shows real data
- Provides plausible deniability under coercion
- Implementation: Hidden volume concept

### PHASE 6: SECURITY TESTING & VALIDATION (Week 10)
Status: [ ] Not Started
Priority: CRITICAL

#### 6.1 Professional Security Assessment
- Hire actual security researchers/cryptographers
- Professional penetration testing
- Code audit by cryptography experts
- Bug bounty program for ongoing security

#### 6.2 Formal Security Analysis
- Mathematical proof of security properties
- Threat modeling workshop with experts
- Red team exercises
- Publish security whitepaper

- [ ] Cryptographer signs off on implementation
- [ ] All phases completed and tested
- [ ] Documentation includes honest security limitations
- [ ] Users can make informed decisions about their threat model

## üî• COMMITMENT LEVEL REQUIRED
